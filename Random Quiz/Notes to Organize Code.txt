Quiz Creation Prep

1: CreateTrack - Creates a boolean list that tracks which states have been chosen.  Returns Boolean List
2: dictLoad - Loads the dictionary from the sandc file and copies it to the program.  Returns Nested dictionary
3: randomWrong - Uses the RNG to create three unique numbers, index is cut out.  Returns 3 integers, [0,49]
4: Options - Loads the correct state/capital combination, as well as three other capitals.  Returns a size 5 list

Quiz Creation

Before file loop, create two files, the answer key and the quiz proper.  These will be the master list.

Start Loop

Keep it simple.  Just go through prist from 0 to 49 for each state.


1: Query - Removes the first item from the list pop(0), leaves the remaining answers, size 4 List
#  2: Shuffle - Shuffles the order of the capitals.
3: Loop - Loop a massive block of code 50 fucking times, using prist[i] to choose the state

While in Loop:

1: Question: Print Statements for Question
2: Answer Key: dict{key = question number, value = correct answer}
