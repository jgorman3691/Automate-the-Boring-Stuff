1.) Clipboard Properties
  a: Can only hold one piece/string/item of text
  b: Saves each individual item of text under a keyword
  c: Takes an argument along with (after) program activation
  d: File name is mcb.pyw, format would be: py mcb.pyw [keyword]
  e. Lastly, the argument "list" copies a list of all the keywords to the clipboard

Idea: Basically we have a shelf file with a bunch of text blobs that are identified by their keywords.  Every time we run the program with a keyword, a blob with that identifier gets pulled up into the clipboard.
      If we forget the identifiers, we can use the "list" argument, which will return the list of keywords.

Note: The Use of a shelf is highly encouraged, as is sys.argv, so import sys, and import shelve!

Functions:

Read value from CLI

Open Shelf

Search for appropriate Blob

Clear then Copy Blob to Clipboard

Creates a list of keywords to call

Extra: Print keyword: Glob

Function Skeletons:

ReadCLI (Steps to take)
   Read and save the shelf
    a Create the shelf
    b can treat as a dict (s = shelf, s['keyword] : [text_info'])
   Reads the arguments
   Passes the values: Control Split
    1: if argument is save, then save clipboard contens to keyword blob
    2.: If argument is list, print out the names of all the blobs.
    3: Otherwise, keyword's text blob loaded to clipboard

Note: All these values are in the shelve module!!!

1.) Create Shelf:

import shelve
shelfFile = shelve.open('project')
example = ['Blah', 'Weird but popular porn', 'my mudic collection']
shelfFile['example'] = example
ShelfFile.close()
